### API

**Make Config**

```bash
cp config/app_config.json.example api/app_config.json
```

You can set you own `api_key` in `api/app_config.json`, otherwise, the app will run without authentication.

**Start Server**

```bash
cd api/
```

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### Docker

Build and run the docker image

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The code is deploy based on shared storage, so that you can modify the code in the physical machine and the docker container will automatically update the code. So, do not delete any necessary code files in the physical machine.

Restart the docker container

```bash
docker compose restart
```
